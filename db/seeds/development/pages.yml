Heat the irons; with my own hands I shall burn the eyes from his head that he may not pollute my person with his vile gaze.\"\n\n\"Chieftains of Thark,\" I cried, turning to the assembled council and ignoring Tal Hajus, \"I have been a chief among you, and today I have fought for Thark shoulder to shoulder with her greatest warrior. You owe me, at least, a hearing. I have won that much today. You claim to be just peopleâ€”\"\n\n\"Silence,\" roared Tal Hajus. \"Gag the creature and bind him as I command.\"\n\n\"Justice, Tal Hajus,\" exclaimed Lorquas Ptomel. \"Who are you to set aside the customs of ages among the Tharks.\"\n\n\"Yes, justice!\" echoed a dozen voices, and so, while Tal Hajus fumed and frothed, I continued.\n\n\"You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mighty jeddak during the fighting today? I did not see him in the thick of battle; he was not there. He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men? Why, even I, a midget beside him, felled him with a single blow of my fist. Is it of such that the Tharks fashion their jeddaks? There stands beside me now a great Thark, a mighty warrior and a noble man. Chieftains, how sounds, Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark?\"\n\nA roar of deep-toned applause greeted this suggestion.\n\n\"It but remains for this council to command, and Tal Hajus must prove his fitness to rule. Were he a brave man he would invite Tars Tarkas to combat, for he does not love him, but Tal Hajus is afraid; Tal Hajus, your jeddak, is a coward. With my bare hands I could kill him, and he knows it.\"\n\nAfter I ceased there was tense silence, as all eyes were riveted upon Tal Hajus. He did not speak or move, but the blotchy green of his countenance turned livid, and the froth froze upon his lips.\n\n\"Tal Hajus,\" said Lorquas Ptomel in a cold, hard voice, \"never in my long life have I seen a jeddak of the Tharks so humiliated. There could be but one answer to this arraignment. We wait it.\" And still Tal Hajus stood as though electrified." %>
